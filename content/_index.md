**THIS SITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION!** 

Hi! I'm Walker Harrison and this is my personal website.

I'm a data scientist finishing up my Master's in statistics at Duke University. I code mostly in R (this site was built using the `blogdown` package), but have substantial experience in Python as well.

I'll be using this website primarily to publish blogposts, which will usually showcase how R can be used to reproduce baseball research or to parse and analyze personal data. I used to write regularly about the intersection of statistics and everyday life on my Medium site, [Perplex City](https://perplex.city), but now I'm starting fresh with some more in-depth explorations.
